---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Task 1: Relationship Between Multiple Classes

Objective: Explore class relationships through composition.

Concept Overview:
- Composition in object-oriented programming.
- Objects holding references to other objects.

Requirements:
- Create a Person class with attributes like name and age.
- Include a Car object within the Person class to represent car ownership.

Guidelines:
- Implement methods in the Person class to assign a car to the person and to describe the car owned by the person.

Submission:
- Submit a .cpp file with both class definitions and a main function that demonstrates a Person owning and interacting with their Car.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Task 2: Inheritance

Objective: Learn about inheritance and polymorphism.

Concept Overview:
- Base and derived classes.
- Overriding methods and polymorphic behavior.

Requirements:
- Define a Vehicle base class with attributes like weight and max_speed.
- Derive the Car class from Vehicle and add a unique attribute like fuel_type.
- Override a method from Vehicle in Car.

Guidelines:
- Demonstrate the use of both base and derived class objects in the main function.

Submission:
- Provide a .cpp file showcasing inheritance, method overriding, and the use of base and derived classes.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Task 3: Complex Class Relationships

Objective: Master advanced concepts like aggregation and polymorphism.

Concept Overview:
- Managing collections of objects.
- Dynamic polymorphism and memory management.

Requirements:
- Develop an Fleet class that aggregates multiple Vehicle objects, including Cars and potentially other derived classes.
- Include methods to add, remove, and list vehicles in the fleet.

Guidelines:
- Use an array of Vehicle pointers to demonstrate polymorphic behavior.
- Ensure correct implementation of dynamic memory management, focusing on constructor and destructor usage in Fleet.

Submission:
- Submit a comprehensive .cpp file that manages a fleet of vehicles, using polymorphic methods and ensuring memory is handled properly.
